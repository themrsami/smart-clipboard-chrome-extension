## 🛡️ Security & Privacy (The Important Stuff)

### 🔍 **What We Can Access** (Only when YOU choose):
- ✅ Text you explicitly copy or save
- ✅ Your extension settings and preferences  
- ✅ Selected text when you right-click our menu option

### 🚫 **What We CANNOT Access** (By design):
- 🚫 **Passwords or form data** - We can't see login fields
- 🚫 **Private browsing data** - Extension doesn't work in incognito
- 🚫 **Automatic webpage content** - Only sees what you copy
- 🚫 **Your browsing history** - We don't track where you go
- 🚫 **Personal files** - No access to documents or downloads

## 🤔 Still Have Concerns?

### **"How do I know you're not stealing my data?"**
> **Simple**: We literally can't. The extension has no network permissions and works completely offline. Even if we wanted to steal data (we don't), the code prevents it.

### **"What if I copy sensitive information by accident?"**  
> **No problem**: Use the password protection feature, or simply delete the clip immediately. Nothing is permanent unless you want it to be.

### **"Can you see my passwords when I copy them?"**
> **Absolutely not**: We only see text you explicitly save to the clipboard manager. Copying passwords normally (Ctrl+C) doesn't trigger our extension unless you have auto-save enabled.

### **"What happens if I uninstall the extension?"**
> **Everything disappears**: All clips, settings, and data are permanently deleted. No traces remain anywhere.
