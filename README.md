## 🤔 Still Have Concerns?

### **"How do I know you're not stealing my data?"**
> **Simple**: We literally can't. The extension has no network permissions and works completely offline. Even if we wanted to steal data (we don't), the code prevents it.

### **"What if I copy sensitive information by accident?"**  
> **No problem**: Use the password protection feature, or simply delete the clip immediately. Nothing is permanent unless you want it to be.

### **"Can you see my passwords when I copy them?"**
> **Absolutely not**: We only see text you explicitly save to the clipboard manager. Copying passwords normally (Ctrl+C) doesn't trigger our extension unless you have auto-save enabled.

### **"What happens if I uninstall the extension?"**
> **Everything disappears**: All clips, settings, and data are permanently deleted. No traces remain anywhere.
